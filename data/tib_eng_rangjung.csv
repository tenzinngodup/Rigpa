bar chad kun sel|Dispeller of All Obstacles. Lamey Tukdrub Barchey Künsel
bar chad kun sel kyi chos skor|Barchey Künsel Cycle of Teachings. Here is a short introduction to the Barchey Künsel cycle: The Barchey Künsel is the heart essence of the accomplished master Padmasambhava who perceives the three times in the entirity. It is the quintessence of one billion heart sadhanas of the Guru, the most unique terma buried in the land of Tibet; and it is the first among the Four Cycles of Guru Sadhana. This Guru's Heart Practice that Dispels all Obstacles contains in completeness all the profound key points of the view, meditation and conduct of the Three Inner Yoga Tantras. It manifested from the secret treasury of the great wisdom, the vast realization of the Second Buddha of Uddiyana, as the self-existing natural vajra sounds in perfect melodious tones. Its expressions that are unmodified by the intellect of ordinary people, its words that are without delusion, and its meaning that is unmistaken, are exclusively due to the kindness of the three powerful knowledge-holders [Khyentse, Kongtrül, and Chokling], the great beings of the three families, who incarnated as masters to compile and propagate an ocean of secret teachings. It is exclusively through their kindness that this teaching was established in writing as the splendor of unending welfare and happiness for the disciples in the Land of Snow, and propagated to flourish everywhere. This pure and perfect teaching, which effortlessly bestows, in accordance with one's wishes, the all-encompassing supreme and common siddhis, temporaily and ultimately, was an unprecedented diffusion of the gemstones of the profound meaning, like opening up for the treasury of the universal monarch. DILGO KHYENTSE] About the Barchey Künsel practice, which is the first and most extensive of the Four Cycles of Guru Sadhana, Jamgön Kongtrül says in his Seed of the Great Sal Tree: "Generally, for the basic descriptions of how to practice this, take the third chapter taught in the Sheldam Nyingjang as basis and apply them, following your teacher's oral advice, in the extensive, medium or short version, whichever is appropriate, and in accordance with the situation in terms of place, time, and type of person. Whether you begin development or completion, first perform the general preliminaries of the fourfold mind-training and the four special preliminaries. For the main part, according to the system of Terchen Chokgyur Lingpa, take Sheldam Nyingjang as basis, and first practice Dharmakaya Amitayus followed by the Lotus Magical Net of Sambhogakaya, the Great Compassionate One [Avalokiteshvara]. After that, combine the extensive or medium version with the Nirmanakaya [Padmasambhava], whichever is suitable, and complete the set number [of recitations] for approach and accomplishment. Following that, it is necessary to perform successively the specific approaches, combining the twelve manifestations with Trinley Nyingpo, and complete the four activities and the four ancillary practices as well as the practice of the teaching guardians. According to the system of the omniscient master, Padma Ösel Do-Ngak Lingpa [Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo], perform, as the beginning of the main part, the single mudra according to the Gyüngyi Köljang, the Daily Practice Manual, as 'approach'; the condensed outer mandala of Trinley Nyingpo as the 'full approach;' Trinley Dringpo, the Medium Practice Manual, as 'accomplishment;' and Trinley Gyepa, the Extensive Practice Manual, together with Dzapkyi Köljang, the Recitation Manual, and so forth in a detailed way for the 'great accomplishment.' The samadhis and visualizations for recitation of these should conform with the root text of the third chapter [of Sheldam Nyingjang]. Having properly performed the four aspects of approach and accomplishment, perform then the 'specific practices' such as those for Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and so forth, whichever is suitable. There is no difference between following either of these two systems since they both are lords of these profound teachings."

bla ma rig 'dzin|Guru Vidyadhara. A deity and set of scriptures belonging to the Nine Sadhana Sections. Often the Guru Vidyadhara and the eight herukas in the Eight Sadhana Teachings form a single mandala with nine groups of deities. The chief existing scripture for the teachings on Guru Vidyadhara is called the Root Tantra of the Assemblage of Vidyadharas (rig 'dzin 'dus pa rtsa ba'i rgyud) and is the fifteenth tantra within the Assemblage of Sugatas, an immensely detailed collection of teachings on the Eight Sadhana Teachings and associated Vajrayana material brought to Tibet by Padmasambhava and taught to his main disciple. The Assemblage of Sugatas was concealed as a terma and later revealed by Nyang Ral Nyima Özer. The practice of Guru Vidyadhara is expressed through the principle known as the four aspects of approach and accomplishment. The most detailed terma on this principle was revealed by Sangye Lingpa (1340-1396) and is still renowned as Lama Gongdü (bla ma dgongs 'dus) in 18 volumes of approximately 700 pages each. The Guru Vidyadhara is also the basis for innumerable sadhanas propagated by other tertöns, for instance the Rigdzin Düpa cycle within the termas of Longchen Nyingtig as well as the Barchey Künsel cycle revealed by Chokgyur Lingpa and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo that are both widely practiced to this day

According to the system of Nagarjuna, the Chariot of the Profound View, the precepts are to refrain from the following: to steal the funds of the Three Jewels; to commit the act of forsaking the Dharma; to punish or cause to lose the precepts etc. people who possess or have lapsed from the trainings; to commit the five acts with immediate result; to violate the five definite precepts for a king, such as keeping wrong views and so forth; to violate the five definitive precepts for a minister such as destroying a village, a valley, a city, a district, or a country; to give premature teachings on emptiness to people who haven't trained in the Mahayana; to aspire towards the shravakas of the Hinayana after having reached the Mahayana; to train in the Mahayana after forsaking the Individual Liberation; to disparage the Hinayana; to praise oneself and disparage others; to be highly hypocritical for the sake of honor and gain; to let a monk receive punishment and be humiliated; to harm others by bribing a king or a minister in order to punish them; to give the food of a renunciant meditator to a reciter of scriptures and thus causing obstacles for the cultivation of shamatha. The eighty subsidiary infractions are to forsake the happiness of another being and so forth. According to the system of Asanga, the Chariot of the Vast Conduct, the precepts for the bodhichitta of aspiration are as follows: to never forsake sentient beings, to remember the benefits of bodhichitta, to gather the accumulations, to exert oneself in training in bodhichitta, as well as to adopt and avoid the eight black and white deeds. The four precepts for the bodhichitta of application are (to avoid the following): 1) out of desire, to have exceeding attachment to honor and gain and to praise oneself and disparage others, 2) out of stinginess, to refrain from giving material things, Dharma teachings and wealth to others, 3) out of anger, to harm others and be unforgiving when offered an apology, 4) out of stupidity, to pretend that indolence is Dharma and to teach that to others. The 46 minor infractions are to refrain from making offerings to the Three Jewels and so forth. The four black deeds are to deceive a venerable person, to cause someone to regret what is not regrettable, to disparage a sublime person, and to deceive sentient beings. The four white are their opposites

He received the transmission of Dzogchen from Shri Singha and Jnanasutra. Vimalamitra is regarded as one of the three main forefathers for establishing the Dzogchen teachings, especially the Instruction Section, in Tibet, which he chiefly transmitted to five people: King Trisong Deutsen, Prince Muney Tsenpo, Tingdzin Sangpo of Nyang, Kawa Paltsek and Chokro Lui Gyaltsen. Having translated these extremely profound instructions, he concealed the texts at Samye Chimphu for the sake of future generations. On his departure to the Five-peaked Mountain in China, Vimalamitra made the promise to return once every century in order to clarify and propagate the teachings of the secret, innermost essence, Sangwa Nyingtig. The oral lineage of his teachings on the Instruction Section was continued by Tingdzin Sangpo of Nyang who also concealed one set of the scriptures. one hundred and fifty five years after Vimalamitra departed from Tibet, an emanation of him named Dangma Lhüngyal took out the hidden texts. They are now included in the collection known as Vima Nyingtig, the Heart Essence of Vimalamitra. In his role as lineage holder of Nectar Quality among the Eight Sadhana Teachings, he is counted among the Eight Vidyadharas of India, the receiver of the Eightfold Volume of Nectar Quality. According to this lineage he was born in Elephant Grove, an area in the western part of India. He was learned in both the common and extraordinary topics of knowledge and received teachings on the tantras from Buddhaguhya and many other illustrious masters.

gnas chen nyi shu rtsa bzhi|It is recounted in the Chakrasamvara Tantra and its commentaries (as related in MK) that the world was once ruled by Bhairava, the wrathful form of Mahadeva who made the land of Magadha the seat of his power. It is said also that four devas and four gandharvas descended from the sky and established their dominion in eight places known as the eight Celestial Abodes (mkha' spyod kyi gnas brgyad). Likewise, four yakshas and four rakshasas, already on the earth, made their way to Jambudvipa where they established themselves in eight Earthly Abodes (sa spyod kyi gnas brgyad), while four nagas and four asuras came to Jambudvipa from beneath the earth, to settle themselves in eight Underground Abodes (sa 'og gi gnas brgyad). They invited Bhairava to visit their dwellings, twenty-four in all, but he, instead of coming personally, manifested in each place as a lingam to which these savage beings would make blood sacrifices. These demonic forces prevailed from the "golden age" until the beginning of our present "era of strife and conflict." It was then, the tantra recounts, that the Blessed One, Vajradhara, knew that the time had come to subdue these unsuitable beings. Without his mind ever wavering from objectless compassion, he arose in the formidable wrathful display of a Heruka with four heads and twelve arms. He danced, and through the power of the nondual wisdom of all the Buddhas, trampled down Mahadeva and his consort together with their retinue, liberating their minds into the absolute expanse and establishing them in great bliss. The Heruka then blessed each of the twenty-four abodes as a palace of Chakrasamvara and each of the twenty-four lingams as a mandala of sixty-two wisdom deities. The sixty-two are Chakrasamvara, his consort, and his retinue: the twenty-four male and twenty-four female Bodhisattvas, and the twelve goddesses.
